## Water Feasibility Prediction 

This is a prediction of the feasibility of drinking water using data from Kaggle. I made predictions with my team and I contributed to the analysis and determination of some of the models that are done.

Prediction of the feasibility of household drinking water is very important to ensure that the water consumed is safe and healthy for humans. Poor water quality can cause various health problems, such as stomach ailments, heavy metal poisoning, and even death. In addition, water that is not suitable for drinking can also affect the quality of life and people's welfare.

Predicting the suitability of drinking water in households can also help to identify problems and risks associated with water quality and take necessary preventive measures to improve water quality.
